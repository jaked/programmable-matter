# Programmable Matter

### *A dynamic data-driven document development environment (DDDDDE)*

Did you ever wish your document editor were more like an IDE? Your IDE
more like a spreadsheet? Your spreadsheet more like a database? No?

Programmable Matter is a "document development environment": a rich
text document editor that supports embedded code. You can use code to
assemble documents from components, generate documents from structured
data, and even build simple UIs.

Like an IDE, it provides live feedback about your code (syntax
highlighting, error reporting, code suggestions) and navigation of the
document and code structure.

Like a spreadsheet, it provides live update of results as you make
changes to documents, data, and code; and in the presence of code
errors, the correct parts still run.

Like a database, it provides means of defining structured data tables
and working with them through a uniform interface.

## Status

Work in progress! Lots of unfinished parts, tons of bugs!
